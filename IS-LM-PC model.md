The IS-LM-PC model augments the short run [[IS-LM model]] (goods and financial market) by the labour market through the [[Phillips curve]]. It is thus a medium run model.

The Phillips curve is transformed into a relation between output $Y$ and inflation rate $\pi$:
$$\pi-\pi^e = -\alpha/L(Y-Y_n)$$
Here $Y_n$ is the potential output (under [[Unemployment#NAIRU|NAIRU]]).

The main change from the short run is that now fiscal and monetary policy has an effect on the labour market and thus on inflation. This means for example if inflation expectations are adaptive ($\pi_t^e = \pi_{t-1}$) then a fiscal expansion increases the change in inflation rate and must thus be followed by a recession in order to return the change in inflation to its earlier value.

## Derivation of Okun's law
[[Okun's law]] can be derived from the IS-LM-PC model.
