A competitive equilibrium or Walrasian equilibrium is a price vector and an allocation that has the property of "satisfaction": every agent prefers their allocated bundle to any other to them affordable bundle.

In other words it is a price vector and allocation that solve each individuals [[Utility maximization problem|utility maximization problem]].

More specifically:
An allocation $(x,y)$ is a consumption plan $x_i$ and a production vector $y_j$.

An allocation is feasible if $\sum x_i = \sum y_j+\omega$, where $\omega$ is the initial endowment of resources of the economy.

A private ownership economy is an economy where consumers own shares of firms $\theta_{ij}$ that sum to 1.

Then an allocation $(x,y)$ and a price vector $p$ form a Walrasian or competitive equilibrium if:
+ Firms maximize profits over $Y_j$
+ Consumers optimize consumption over $X_i$ given their budget constraint $px_i = pw_i+\sum\theta_{ij}py_j$
+ The allocation is feasible

A price equilibrium is the same but with additional transfers possible.
