# Properties of estimators
## Residuals
The residual is the unexplained part of an observation $(X_i, y_i)$ and is the difference between the fitted value $\hat y_i = X\hat\beta$ (for a linear model) and the real value $y_i$:
$$\hat e_i = \hat y_i-y_i$$
## Goodness of fit
The total variance in the dependent variable $y$ can be decomposed into a part that is explained by the estimation/regression and an unexplained or residual part.
The goodness of fit of an estimation is given by the ratio of the explained variation over the total variation:
$$R^2 = SSE/SST$$
