Inflation is a rise in the general  price level. The inflation rate is defined as:
$$\pi_t = (P_t-P_{t-1})/P_{t-1}$$
Where $P_t$ is the price level in period $t$.
"Negative inflation" is called deflation.

There are different ways of measuring inflation:
+ GDP deflator - here the price level is set equal to the ratio of [[Gross Domestic Product#Nominal GDP|nominal GDP]] to [[Gross Domestic Product#Real GDP|real GDP]] in a given year:
  $$P_t = ~â‚¬Y_t/Y_t$$The GDP deflator includes all goods that have been produced in the given year.
+ CPI (Consumer Price Index) - compared to the GDP deflator, the CPI only takes into account a predefined bundle of consumer goods - thus giving a more representative estimate for the inflation that consumers face.

The economic significance of inflation stems from the fact that prices for different goods don't rise or fall equally. This implies that relative prices change and income and wealth are redistributed.
