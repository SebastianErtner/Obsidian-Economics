GDP is a measure of aggregate output in an economy in a given time frame. It is determined in a system of national accounts ("Volkswirtschaftliche Gesamtrechnung").

There are three coinciding definitions of GDP:
1. GDP is the value of final goods produced ("Verwendungsrechnung")
2. GDP is the sum of value added ("Entstehungsrechnung")
3. GDP is the sum of incomes ("Verteilungsrechnung")

Nominal GDP $â‚¬Y_t$ is the GDP expressed current prices.
Real GDP $Y_t$ is the GDP expressed in the prices of a given base year.

The uses of GDP include comparison between contries, comparison over time periods, basis for fiscal policy, indicator of welfare.

For comparisons between countries, GDP values are made comparable by establishing purchasing power parity.
