If preferences of an economic agent fulfill [[Utility function#|the required axioms]] such that a utility representation exists, then their [[Decision making concepts|choice]] decision can be understood as a utility maximization problem in which the agent maximizes their utility $u(\cdot)$ over their set of choices $A$:
$$\max_{a \in A} u(a)$$
Usually this maximization is subject to constraints like a budget constraint.
