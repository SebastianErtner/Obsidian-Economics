# Goods market

Consumption equation: $C = c_0+c_1Y_D$
with $c_0$ the minimum consumption
$c_1$ the marginal propensity to consume
$Y_D=Y-T$ disposable income

demand for goods:
$Z = C+I+G$

goods market equilibrium:
$Z = Y$

Solve for equilibrium:
$Y = c_0+c_1(Y-T)+I+G$
$Y = \frac{1}{1-c_1}[c_0+I+G-c_1T]$

$1/(1-c_1)$ is called the "mulitplicator" and the term in brackets is called autonomous expenses.

Private savings:
$S = Y_D-C$
Public savings:
$T-G$

Then in equilibrium:
$Y = C+I+G$
implies:
$S = I+(T-G)$
the IS-equation or "investment equals saving"

Therefore the equilibrium on the goods market can be characterized by:
Demand = Production
Investment = Saving

## Savings paradox
If consumers reduce $c_0$ to save more of their disposable income, this only reduces $C$ and $Y$; but as $I$ remains unchanged, savings do not actually increase.

# Financial market
Simple model where consumers only hold money or bonds.
Then money demand is proportional to output level (more transactions necessary) and inversely proportional to the interest rate on bonds.
$$M = â‚¬YL(i)$$
Where $L(i)$ is a downward sloping function of $i$.

In equilibrium on the financial market, the central bank supplies a fixed amount of money.

## Liquidity trap
Once the interest rate has reached zero, increasing the money supply cannot decrease it any further (as money and bonds at this point both give zero interest). That means the central bank cannot use this instrument anymore.

# The IS-LM model
Different to before, we now assume that investements depend on positively on output and negatively on interest rate:
$$I(Y,i)$$
This gives us the IS-equation:
$$Y = C(Y,T)+I(Y,i)+G$$
The LM-equation follows from the financial market:
$$M/P = YL(i)$$
Both markets are in equilibrium when the equations both hold:

# Extended IS-LM model
For their investment decisions, firms take into account the expected real interest rate $r$ instead of the nominal interest rate $i$ as assumed above. They differ by the expected inflation rate $\pi_t^e$:
$$ r_t \approx i_t-\pi_t^e$$
Further they face a risk premium $x$ for their loan demanded by the bank.

Then the extended IS-LM model becomes:
IS: $Y = C(Y,T)+I(r+x)+G$
LM: $r = \bar r$
