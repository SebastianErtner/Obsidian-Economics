Different time horizons:

In the short run (years), evolution of output is determined by demand. Policy aims to react to shocks.
See [[IS-LM model]].

In the medium run (decades), evolution of output is determined by supply.
Policy aims to reach natural unemployment and potential output.
See [[IS-LM-PC model]].

In the long run (multiple decades), evolution of output is determined by technological growth and investment. Policy aims to achieve growth.
See [[Solow growth model]].

More generally, the determinants of growth are modeled in [[Growth models|growth models]].
