# Permutations
A permutation is a selection where the order of elements is important.
## Permutation with repetition
Number of: $n^k$
## Permutations without repetition
Number of: ${}_{n}P_k = n!/(n-k)!$

# Combinations
A combination is a selection where the order of elements is not important.
## Combinations without repetition
Number of: ${}_{n}C_k = {n\choose k} = {}_{n}P_k/k! = n!/[(n-k)!k!]$
## Combinations with repetition
Number of: ${n+k-1\choose k}$
