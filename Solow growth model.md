The Solow growth model is a simple model that captures the growth of output over time.

Central assumptions:
+ closed economy $I = S+(T-G)$
+ no public saving, so $I = S$
+ private saving is proportional to income $S = sY$
+ production function has:
	+ constant returns to scale $xF(L,K) = F(xL,xK)$
	+ falling marginal return of inputs

Capital accumulation:
$$k_{t+1} = (1-\delta)k_t+sf(k_t)$$
Steady state:
$$sf(k^*) = \delta k^*$$

Golden rule level of the savings rate:
Maximizes per capita consumption in the steady state.

Dynamic inefficiency:
If the current savings rate is above the golden rule level, then ther is dynamic inefficiency - it could be reduced, increasing consumption in the current period and in all future periods (through growth).
