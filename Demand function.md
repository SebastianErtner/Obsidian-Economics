# Walrasian Demand
Obtained by solving the [[Utility maximization problem|utility maximization problem]] of an individual: 
$$x^* = D(p,M)$$
Inserting the Walrasian demand function into the utility function gives the [[Indirect utility function]]:
$$v(p,M) = u(D(p,M))$$

# Hicksian Demand
Obtained by solvin the [[Expense minimization problem|expense minimization problem]] of an individual:
$$x^* = H(p,\bar u)$$
Inserting the Hicksian demand function into the budget equation gives the [[Expenditure function|expenditure function]]
