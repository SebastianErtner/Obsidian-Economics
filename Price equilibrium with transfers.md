An allocation $(x,y)$ and a price vector $p$ constitute a price equilibrium with transfers if there is an assignment of wealth levels $w$ with $\sum w_i = p\omega+\sum py_j$ such that:
+ firms maximize profits $py_j \leq py_j^*$
+ consumers optimize consumption with regard to their budget constraint $px_i \leq w_i$
+ the allocation is feasible

The [[Competitive equilibrium|Walrasian equilibrium]] is a special case of the price equilibrium with transfers.
