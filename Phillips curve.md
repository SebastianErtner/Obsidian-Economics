The Phillips curve is an empirical obersvation of a relationship between [[Unemployment|unemployment rate]] and (change in) [[Inflation|inflation rate]].
For the EU15 (1981-2015):
$$\pi_t-\pi_{t-1} = 4.4\%-0.73u_t$$
Higher unemployment implies a decrease in inflation rate.

## Original Phillips curve
Between unemployment rate and inflation rate.

## Expectations-augmented Phillips curve
Between unemployment rate and change in inflation rate.

## Derivation
The Phillips curve can be derived from the labour market.
Wage setting equation:
$$W_t/P_t^e = F(u,z)$$
Price setting equation:
$$P_t = (1+m)W_t$$

With the assumption $F(u,z) = 1-\alpha u+z$ we approximatively find the Phillips curve:
$$\pi_t = \pi_t^e+(m+z)-\alpha u_t$$

Inflation rate expectations can differ:
+ "stable" expectations, $\pi_t^e = \bar \pi$, give the original Phillips curve observed in the 60s
+ "adaptive" expectation, $\pi_t^e = \pi_{t-1}$, give the modified version

Inflation is not accelerated if it is equal to its expectations and the unemployment rate is the [[Unemployment#NAIRU|NAIRU]] $u_n$:
$$u_n = (m+z)/\alpha$$
This gives us an alternative representation of the Phillips curve:
$$\pi_t-\pi_t^e = -\alpha(u_t-u_n)$$
