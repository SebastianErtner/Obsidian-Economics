Employment $N$ is the number of people currently working.
Unemployment $U$ is the number of people who do not, **but who are looking for work**.
Labour force $L$ is the number of people who are in principle able and willing to work.
It holds that:
$$L = N + U$$
The unemployment rate $u$ is defined as the ratio between unemployed and labour force:
$$u = U/L$$
The economic significance of unemployment stems from the fact that unemployment is correlated with unhappiness and that in a market economy personal survival depends on a source of income.

## NAIRU
The non accelerating inflation rate of unemployment is that rate of unemployment $u_n$, for which inflation is equal to expected inflation, as in that case inflation is not accelerated according to the [[Phillips curve]].
