The elasticity of substitution measures how the demand ratio reacts to a change in the price ratio of two goods. 
TODO: rewrite with MRTS

$$\sigma = - \frac{\partial(x_1/x_2)}{\partial(p_1/p_2)}\frac{(p_1/p_2)}{(x_1/x_2)}$$
A utility function that has constant elasticity of substitution is called a [[CES utility function|CES-utility function]].
