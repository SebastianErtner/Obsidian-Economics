# Arrow-Pratt measure of absolute risk aversion
Risk aversion is captured in the curvature of the utility function at a given consumption bundle $c$. Since utility functions represent identical preferences under affine transformations, using curvature alone as a measure would not be constant under such a transformation. Therefore we also divide by the first derivative to nullify the influence of any such transformation.
$$AR(c) = -\frac{u''(c)}{u'(c)}$$

# Arrow-Pratt measure of relative risk aversion
The Arrow-Pratt measure of absolute risk aversion has the drawback that it is not dimensionless. This is aleviated by adjusting the measure to measure relative risk aversion instead.

$$RR(c) = -\frac{cu''(c)}{u'(c)}$$
