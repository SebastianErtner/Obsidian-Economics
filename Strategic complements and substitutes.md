## Strategic complement
The strategic variables in a competition among firms are said to be strategic complements if best response functions are upward sloping, i.e. an increase in the variable of one firm leads to an increase in the variable of other firms. Example: price in Bertrand competition

## Strategic substitute
Equivalently, strategic variables are said to be strategic substitutes if best response functions are downward sloping, i.e. an increase in the variable of one firm leads to a decrease in the variable of other firms. Example: quantity in Cournot competition
