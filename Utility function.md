# As a representation of a preference relation
A [[Preference relations|preference relation]] that is:
* rational (that is complete and transitive)
* reflexive
* continuous
can be represented by a continuous utility function.

Alternatively, a preference relation that is:
* rational (that is complete and transitive)
* reflexive
* defined on a countable set $X$
can be represented by a utility function.

# Ordinal or cardinal utility representations
For microeconomic applications we mostly only need ordinal (=absolute values and distances are irrelevant) utility functions. There, under a monotonic transformation $T(.)$, $v(x) = T(u(x))$ represents the same preferences. The marginal rate of substitution will not change.

In game theory we often need cardinal (=absolute values and distances are relevant) utility functions, there only affine transformations $v(x) = a\cdot u(x)+b$ are allowed. (Other monotonic transformations usually will change optimal strategies.)
