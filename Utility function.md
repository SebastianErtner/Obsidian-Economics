# As a representation of a preference relation
A [[Preference relations|preference relation]] that is:
* rational (that is complete and transitive)
* reflexive
* continuous
can be represented by a continuous utility function.

Alternatively, a preference relation that is:
* rational (that is complete and transitive)
* reflexive
* defined on a countable set $X$
can be represented by a utility function.

# Ordinal or cardinal utility representations
For microeconomic applications we mostly only need ordinal (=absolute values and distances are irrelevant) utility functions. There, under a monotonic transformation $T(.)$, $v(x) = T(u(x))$ represents the same preferences as $u(x)$. The marginal rate of substitution will not change.

In game theory we often need cardinal (=absolute values and distances are relevant) utility functions, there only affine transformations $v(x) = a\cdot u(x)+b$ with $a>0$ are allowed. (Other monotonic transformations often will change optimal strategies, especially in mixed strategies.)

## Common properties
+ convex preferences -> concave utility function (decreasing marginal utility)
+ monotonicity (more is better)

## Homothethic preferences 
A consumer's preferences are homothetic if they can be represented by a [[Math for microeconomics#Homoegenous function|homogeneous]] utility function of degree 1.
