The usual target function of [[Utility maximization problem|utility maximization]] in intertemporal models (e.g. [[Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models|DGSE]]), where [[Utility function|utility]] of consumption in future periods is discounted:
$$U(\{c_t\}) = \sum_{t = 0}^\infty \beta^t u(c_t)$$
