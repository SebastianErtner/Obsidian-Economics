Consumption equation: $C = c_0+c_1Y_D$
with $c_0$ the minimum consumption
$c_1$ the marginal propensity to consume
$Y_D=Y-T$ disposable income

goods market equilibrium:
$Z = Y$

demand for goods:s
$Y = C+I+G$

Solve for equilibrium:
$Y = c_0+c_1(Y-T)+I+G$
$Y = \frac{1}{1-c_1}[c_0+I+G-c_1T]$

Financial market:
$I(r,z)$
