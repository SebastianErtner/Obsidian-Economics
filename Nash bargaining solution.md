Cooperative bargaining

Nash: Solution should satisfy axioms:
+ invariant under affine transformations or invariant to equivalent utility representations
+ Pareto optimal
+ independence of irrelevant alternatives
+ symmetry

Nash proved that the solutions satisfying these are the points $(x,y)$ in the bargaining set for which the following is maximized:
$$(u(x)-u(d))(v(y)-v(d))$$
Where $u$ and $v$ are the respective utility functions and $d$ is the outside option.
