# Societal learning under heterogeneous preferences

For my master thesis I want to examine the trade-off between societal learning
and learning from own experiences that arises from heterogeneity in individu-
als' characteristics. In particular I want to study how differences in preferences
among individuals of the population affect their learning behavior. My intuition
is that in those decision problems where humans can benefit from learning from
others via imitation, they will generally have similar but not fully identical pref-
erences over outcomes. This implies that the best outcome for one individual
will also yield good results for the next individual, but not their best result. I
would expect that individuals will then want to not only learn from others, but
also value their own experiences, i.e. learn from their own past. The cost of
learning from one's own past instead of from others is that one forgoes knowl-
edge already gained by the collective. However, once the knowledge of others
has a limited applicability to an individual's situation they will want to seek
out knowledge sources that have a higher applicability. Their own experiences
are one such source that is readily available and fully applicable. The degree to
which their preferences differ will have an effect on an individual's valuation of
learning from others compared to learning from their own past.

Some aspects that could be interesting to consider:
+ The setting should have [[Entry and exit]], as this will enable individuals to
make use of collective knowledge (that was gathered before their entry)
+ A [[Base Case]] of comparison would be between one individual that learns
from their own past and one other (one round memory), one individual
that learns form two other (one round memory) and one individual that
only learns from their own past (two round memory)
+ There might be [[Different strategies]] possible, e.g. learning from
the collective first, then from own past experiences
+ Especially for preferences that differ more strongly it might be interesting
to examine the possibility of [[Signals]] sent by different "preference groups"
to be able to identify those individuals that have preferences that are more
similar to one's own

The general setting:
