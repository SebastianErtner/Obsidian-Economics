## Strictly dominated
An alternative $a \in A$ is strictly dominated by $a' \in \Delta A$ if $u(a,\omega) < u(a',\omega)$ for all $\omega \in \Omega$.

## Weakly dominated
An alternative $a \in A$ is weakly dominated by $a' \in \Delta A$ if $u(a,\omega) \leq u(a',\omega)$ for all $\omega \in \Omega$ and strict inequality for at least one $\omega \in \Omega$.
