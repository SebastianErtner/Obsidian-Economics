Expected utility theory says that under certain axiom an agent who chooses their preferred lottery among a set of lotteries acts as if they were choosing the lottery with the maximum value of expected utility.

Axioms that the preference relation over lotteries $\succ$ must fulfill:
- completeness: $L \succ M \lor M \succ L$
- transitivity: $L \succ M \land M \succ N \Rightarrow L \succ N$
- continuity: $L \succ M \succ N \Leftrightarrow \exists\ p \in [0,1]: pL+(1-p)N \sim N$
- independence: $L \succ M \Leftrightarrow pL+(1-p)N \succ pM+(1-p)N$
