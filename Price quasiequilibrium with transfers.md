An allocation $(x,y)$ and a price vector $p$ constitute a price quasiequilibrium with transfers if there is an assignment of wealth levels $w$ with $\sum w_i = p\omega+\sum py_j$ such that (where $\omega$ is the initial endowment of goods):
+ $py_j' \leq py_j$
+ $px_i' \geq w_i$ expenditure minimization
+ $\sum x_i^* = \sum y_j^*+\sum \omega_i$ (the allocation is feasible)

This is a weaker notion than the competitive equilibrium!
