In a mixed strategy the player mixes over two or more alternatives or [[Strategy|pure strategies]], i.e. they determine the alternative they play randomly according to a given distribution.

Mixing predominantly makes sense in [[Strategic game|strategic games]], specifically in mixed equilibria. That means a player is mixing in order to make the other player(s) indifferent between their actions. An example is the game matching pennies, where no other [[Nash equilibrium]] exists.

Mixing usually does not make sense in a [[Decision problem|decision problem]], as the "other player" is nature, which always mixes according to the given state distribution $\Delta\Omega$. There are some exceptions, e.g. when showing that another action is [[Strategic dominance|strictly dominated]].
