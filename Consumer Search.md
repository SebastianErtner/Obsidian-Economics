Consumers have to invest time and resources to get information about price and/or product. That means there is a cost associated to searching.
+ sequential search
+ simultaneous search


Diamond paradox: 
There is only one equilibrium for arbitrarily small search costs:
+ all firms charge monopoly prices
+ all consumers do not search more than once (i.e. buy at first firm)

Varian's model of sales:
+ two types of consumers - shoppers and loyal consumers
-> mixed strategy EQ

Exogenous search (exogenously fixed sample size):
-> mixed strategy EQ

Endogenous fixed sample search:
+ consumers decide beforehand on number out of $N$ firms they want to search
-> mixed pricing
-> consumers mix between searching once or twice
-> EQ solution independent of $N$
