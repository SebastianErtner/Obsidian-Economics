# Necessary and sufficient conditions
If $A \Rightarrow B$, then $B$ is necessary for $A$, while $A$ is sufficient for $B$.
In other words:
+ necessary: For $A$ to be true, it is necessary that $B$ is also true.
+ sufficient: For $B$ to be true, it is sufficient that $A$ is true. But $B$ can be true without $A$ being true.
