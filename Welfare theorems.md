# First welfare theorem

If [[Preference relations|preferences]] are transitive and locally nonsatiated and $((x,y), p)$ is a [[price equilibrium with transfers]], then $(x,y)$ is Pareto optimal.

# Second welfare theorem

If preferences are convex and locally nonsatiated and the production set is convex, then for every Pareto optimal allocation there exists a price vector such that ((x,y),p) is a [[Price quasiequilibrium with transfers|price quasiequilibirum with transfers]].

CPW: Given an economy without specification of ownership rights $((X_i,\succeq_i),Y_i,w)$. Then for a given Pareto optimal allocation a price vector exists s.t. $(x,y,p,w)$ is a price quasiequilibrium with transfers.

Implications:
Don't touch relative prices but instead redistribute.
