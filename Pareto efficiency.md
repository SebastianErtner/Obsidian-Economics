An allocation is called Pareto efficient, if there does not exist another allocation, under which at least one individual is better off while no individual is worse off.

Pareto efficiency is necessary for social efficiency/optimum(?).

A market allocation that is not Pareto efficient cannot be a market equilibrium (would contradict the [[Welfare theorems#First welfare theorem|first welfare theorem]]).
